        <h1>Hierarchic Nesting Demo</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how to nicely expand and collapse sub-graphs organized in groups. Folding
          ('collapsed groups') can help to keep complex hierarchically organized diagrams clear and
          straightforward by showing only parts of the entire structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, each user action triggers a run of the
          <em>incremental mode</em>
          of the
          <em>hierarchic layout algorithm</em>
          to ensure that the currently visible part of the graph is always well-organized but
          remains still similar to the previous arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recursive edges are edges whose source is inside a group node while its target is outside
          this group node, and vice versa. When those edges leave a group node at the side to reach
          a node left or right of the group node, information to keep the layout stable after
          expanding/collapsing the group node may be lost.
          <br />
          Therefore, a new routing style is introduced which will preserve this information. This
          routing style forces all edges to enter groups at the top and leave them at the bottom.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Expand or collapse a group node with the
            <code>+</code>
            or
            <code>-</code>
            button.
