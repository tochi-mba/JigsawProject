# Interactive Graph Restructuring Demo

# Interactive Graph Restructuring Demo

A demo that shows how to interactively relocate subtrees from one parent to another.

Every time that a node is selected, the subtree rooted at this particular node is dragged interactively, and [ClearAreaLayout](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/ClearAreaLayout) will try to create free space by pushing away the other elements of the graph so that the dragged subtree is relocated to another parent.

## Things to Try

Drag a node with its subtree to another location and see how the graph tries to accommodate it. The node that is highlighted will be the new parent of the moved subtree.
