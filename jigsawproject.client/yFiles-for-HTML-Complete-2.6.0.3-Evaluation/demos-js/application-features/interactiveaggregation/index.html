        <h1>Interactive Aggregation Demo</h1>

        <p>This demo shows how to analyze a graph by aggregating groups of nodes.</p>
        <p>
          Via the context menu, groups of nodes of the same color or shape can be aggregated giving
          different insights about the graph.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, aggregating all nodes by
          <em>shape and color</em>
          shows that there are no connections between rectangle shaped nodes of different color and
          no connections between octagonal green and purple nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demo makes use of the
          <em>AggregationGraphWrapper</em>
          class, that allows for aggregating graph items by hiding items and adding new items to a
          wrapped graph.
        </p>
        <h2>Things to Try</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Right click on a node to open a
            <em>context menu</em>
            with the different aggregation and expansion options.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aggregate all nodes with the
            <em>same shape or color</em>
            by selecting "Aggregate Nodes with Same ...".
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Separate</em>
            an aggregation node again by selecting "Separate".
          </li>
          <li>
            Right click on an empty location on the canvas and select "Aggregate All Nodes by ..."
            to
            <em>group all nodes</em>
            by shape or color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right click on an empty location on the canvas and select "Separate All" to show the
            whole graph again.
          </li>
        </ul>
