        <h1>Process Mining Visualization Demo</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how to extract a graph from an event log and create an animated
          visualization of a process flow. The diagram shows the various steps in a processing
          pipeline and how entities move through the pipeline.
        </p>

        <p>
          A heat map shows which elements in the graph are nearing their capacity limit. A custom
          node style for each process step shows the name of the process and the current load.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visualization is able to render several thousand process entities at the same time in
          a smooth animation. It leverages WebGL for that purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event log is created by a simulator and can be replaced with custom data in the demo
          code. Note that the event log needs to consist of certain type described in
          <code>event-log-types.ts</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Watch the animation.</li>
          <li>Zoom into and out of the graph.</li>
          <li>
            When the animation is finished, you can use the slider to rewind and inspect certain
            time snapshots.
          </li>
          <li>Press the play button to restart the animation.</li>
        </ul>
