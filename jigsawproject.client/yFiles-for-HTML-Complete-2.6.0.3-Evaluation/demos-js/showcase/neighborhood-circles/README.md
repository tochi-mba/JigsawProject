# Neighborhood Circles Demo

# Neighborhood Circles Demo

The Neighborhood Circles demo shows the neighborhood of selected nodes arranged on concentric circles. The concentric arrangement highlights how close the connection between a selected node and a neighbor node is.

The following neighborhood types are available:

- Predecessors
- Successors
- Both (predecessors and successors)
- Neighbors (independent of the edge direction)

## Things to Try

- Change the neighborhood type of the view.
- Change the depth parameter to change the scope of the neighborhood.
- Navigate the graph by clicking nodes in the neighborhood view.

## Remarks

- The neighborhood view is using [RadialLayout](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/RadialLayout) to arrange the neighbor nodes on concentric circles.
