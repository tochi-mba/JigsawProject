  <p style='margin-top:0'>Finding the <em>minimum spanning tree</em> in a graph is part of analyzing graph structures.</p>
  <p>Which edges are included in the minimum spanning tree can be influenced with costs. Edges with lower costs are more likely kept in the tree. </p>
  <p>Costs can be specified using <em>edge labels</em>. The cost of edges without labels is their <em>edge length</em>. When the algorithm should use
  <em>Uniform costs</em> all edges are treated the same. For the sake of simplicity, in this demo we allow only positive edge-costs.</p>`
