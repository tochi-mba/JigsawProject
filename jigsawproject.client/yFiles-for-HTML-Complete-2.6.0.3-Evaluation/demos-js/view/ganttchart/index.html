        <h1>Gantt Chart Demo</h1>

        <p>The Gantt Chart demo shows how to create a Gantt component from JSON data.</p>
        <p>
          The data consists of tasks which define the horizontal lanes and activities, each of which
          is assigned to a task.
        </p>
        <p>
          An activity has a start and an end date, and optionally a lead and/or a follow-up time.
          Also, an activity can optionally depend on other activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The activity duration is rendered as a solid area. The lead and follow-up times are
          rendered with a hatch pattern.
        </p>
        <p>The activity dependencies are modeled as edges between the activity nodes.</p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Scroll the tasks using the mouse wheel.</li>
          <li>Scroll the timeline horizontally using shift + mouse wheel.</li>
          <li>Hover over an activity to highlight its dependencies.</li>
          <li>Hover over a dependency edge to highlight its source and target.</li>
          <li>Select an activity to display the activity information.</li>
          <li>
            Grab and drag an activity to change the start and end time, or to assign an activity to
            a different task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grab the left or right side of the solid area of an activity and drag to change the
            duration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select an activity and drag one of the round handles on the left or right to change the
            lead or follow-up time.
          </li>
          <li>Select an activity and press 'F2' to change its name.</li>
          <li>
            Drag an activity so it overlaps with other activities in the same task lane. The
            activities are placed below each other so they don't overlap.
          </li>
          <li>Drag the mouse on an empty part of a task lane to create a new activity.</li>
          <li>Shift-drag from a node to create a new dependency edge.</li>
        </ul>
