                Apart from the aforementioned Redistributable(s), in order to run, a yFiles for HTML
                application needs a valid license.
              </p>
              <p>
                Evaluation versions of yFiles for HTML come with a pre-generated evaluation license
                file that is located in <code>lib/license.json</code>. You can include this file in
                any HTML page that uses the library.

              <p>
                Before distributing your application, we highly recommend that you obfuscate and
                minify the resulting application. This reduces the download size of the library
                files for your end users and protects your intellectual property by making the
                application source code harder to read.
