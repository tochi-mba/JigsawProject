        <p>
          This demo shows how to integrate yFiles in a{' '}
          <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            SolidJS
          </a>{' '}
          application with{' '}
          <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            TypeScript
          </a>{' '}
          in project bootstrapped with{' '}
          <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Vite
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          This application consists of separate components for the different parts, i.e. the yFiles{' '}
          <code>GraphComponent</code>, the toolbar and the sidebars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nodes are rendered via the <code>SolidNodeTemplate</code> component class and the node
          labels via the <code>SolidLabelTemplate</code> component class.
        </p>
        <h2>Running the demo</h2>
        <p>
          The demo is using the <code>Vite</code> for tooling, thus the following steps are required
          to start it:
        </p>
        <code>
          &gt; npm install <br />
          &gt; npm run dev
        </code>
        <p>This will start the development server of the toolkit.</p>
        <h2>Things to Try</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clicking the buttons in the toolbar will execute certain actions in the SolidJS
            component for the diagram.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the graph has been changed, click <img src={reloadIcon} alt="reload-icon" /> to
            reload the initial sample graph.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vite's development server automatically updates the application upon code changes.
          </li>
        </ul>
