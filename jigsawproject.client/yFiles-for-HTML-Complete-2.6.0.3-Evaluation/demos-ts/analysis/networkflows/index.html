        <h1>Network Flows Demo</h1>

        <p>
          <em>Network flow</em> algorithms apply to directed networks in which edges have certain
          capacities and a flow moves from source nodes (i.e., nodes with in-degree 0) to sink nodes
          (i.e., nodes with out-degree 0).
        </p>
        <p>
          In our everyday life, flow algorithms can be applied to all problem domains that involve
          networks (e.g., water supply, electricity/power, internet, shipment) in which the goal is
          to move some flow (e.g., water, electricity/power, products, internet traffic, message)
          from one position to another within the network as efficient as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demo presents three flow algorithms that will be applied on a network with water
          pipes. The thickness of each edge indicates the edge capacity while the blue-colored part
          the flow load. The label of each edge is in form "flow / capacity".
        </p>
        <p>
          The blue part in the interior of each node indicates the flow that comes across the node
          through the incoming edges. Source nodes are bounded by a green rectangle, while sink
          nodes by a red rectangle. For "Minimum Cost" algorithm, source nodes are also the ones
          that can "supply" flow to the network, while sink nodes are those that "demand" flow from
          the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user can select one of the provided algorithms using the combo-box in the toolbar. The
          result of each algorithm is also visualized in the toolbar. In the case where for some
          reason, no feasible solution is found, the result will be -1. Possible changes to the flow
          due to another algorithm selection or user interaction are highlighted temporary with
          orange color.

              <h2>Maximum Flow</h2>
              The <em>maximum flow</em> problem seeks to determine the maximum load that a network
              can handle considering a capacity constraint. Applications of the maximum flow
              algorithm include the following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Determine the maximum amount of data that can be sent through a computer network.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Find the maximum amount of fluids (e.g. water or oil) that a network of pipelines
                  can supply.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Calculate the amount of goods that a company can transport from warehouses to
                  stores depending on the number of available trucks and the state of the roads.

              <h2>Minimum Cost Flow</h2>
              The <em>minimum cost flow</em> describes the flow through a network that produces the
              lowest cost. The solution depends on the edges' capacity and cost. Some nodes can
              supply flow to the network while others can demand flow from the network. Applications
              of the minimum cost algorithm include the following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Find the parts in pipelines or data networks that handle the most flow and would
                  affect the flow the most when they fail.
                </li>

                  Solve the transportation problem where a certain demand of goods must by satisfied
                  by a number of warehouses such that the transportation costs are minimized.

                  Drag the blue-part of a node to increase its supply or demand. The label in the
                  interior of the node indicates the flow that comes across after the algorithm has
                  been applied plus/minus the corresponding supply/demand respectively. Nodes
                  bounded by a green rectangle represent "supply" nodes, while nodes bounded by a

              The <em>maximum flow minimum cut</em> problem determines the maximum amount of flow
              that can be sent through the network and calculates the <em>minimum cut</em>. A cut
              separates the network such that source and sink nodes are disconnected and no flow
              from the source can reach the sink. The <em>minimum cut</em> is the cut with the
              minimum capacity and its value equals to the <em>maximum flow</em>. Applications of
              the maximum flow minimum cut algorithm include the following:
