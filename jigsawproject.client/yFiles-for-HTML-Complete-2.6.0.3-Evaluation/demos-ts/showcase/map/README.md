# Map Demo

# Map Demo

This demo shows how to integrate a [GraphComponent](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphComponent) with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

The `GraphComponent` is included in a custom Leaflet Layer. The placement of the nodes uses geo-coordinates to get the correct locations on the map.

## Things to Try

- Drag the map and see how the graph moves along.
- Zoom into the map using the mouse-wheel or the controls in the upper-left corner of the map. The nodes mark the location of the airports and will keep their geolocation. Some of them are only visible on larger zoom levels.
- Click on two nodes to highlight the shortest path between those nodes.
