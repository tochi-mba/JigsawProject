# Home Automation Demo

# Home Automation Demo

This demo simulates a tool for visually programming a home automation network. The nodes represent various stages of data flow within the system. The graph features basic validation: output ports can only be connected to input ports, no edges can be duplicated, and nodes with required properties display an error indicator if some of those properties are missing.

### Things to Try

- Add nodes by dragging and dropping them from the node palette on the right.
- Connect nodes. Note that the output port (right) of one node can only connect to the input port (left) of another node.
- Reconnect existing edges to other nodes.
- Select a node to highlight all of its connected edges.
- Move connected nodes around to see how edges dynamically change their shape.
- Apply automatic _Layout_ to arrange the graph hierarchically.
- Select a node to view and edit its properties in the right panel.
- Enter a long _label_ in the node properties to observe how the node size changes.
- Note that some node properties are required. If not set, the corresponding node will display an error indicator. Hover over a node to see a popup with more details about the missing properties.
- Save/load the current graph using JSON.
