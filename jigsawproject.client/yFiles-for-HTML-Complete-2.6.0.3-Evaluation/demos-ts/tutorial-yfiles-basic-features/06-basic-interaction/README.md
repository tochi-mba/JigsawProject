# 06 Basic Interaction - Tutorial: Basic Features

# Basic Interaction

## How to add basic interaction.

This step shows the [default interaction gestures](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/interaction) that are provided by class [GraphEditorInputMode](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphEditorInputMode).

Interaction is handled by interface [IInputMode](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/IInputMode). [GraphEditorInputMode](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphEditorInputMode) is the main input mode that already provides a large number of user interaction features, such as moving, deleting, creating, and resizing graph elements. See the [API documentation](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphEditorInputMode) for the various configuration options.

```
graphComponent.inputMode = new GraphEditorInputMode()
```

- Click a single element with the mouse to select it. `Shift-click` the text to select the element’s label. To select multiple elements, either extend an existing selection by pressing `Ctrl` while clicking, or drag a selection rectangle over all graph elements that you want in your selection. `Ctrl+Α` selects all nodes and bends.
- Resize a node by dragging one of the handles that appear on selected nodes.
- Drag a selected node or bend to move it.
- Click and drag an edge at the desired bend location to create an edge bend.
- To create an edge, start dragging anywhere on the unselected source node and release the mouse button over the target node.
- To create a bend during edge creation, release the left mouse button anywhere on an empty spot of the canvas while dragging. Click to create more bends.
- Nodes may specify multiple port locations (by default, there is only a single port at the node center). You can either create an edge directly between these ports, or later move the source or target to a different port (just select the edge and drag the edge’s source or target handle). Note that custom port locations are not part of this tutorial step, but are introduced later.
- To create or edit a label, select a node or an edge and press `F2`.
- Drag a selected label to move it to another location.
