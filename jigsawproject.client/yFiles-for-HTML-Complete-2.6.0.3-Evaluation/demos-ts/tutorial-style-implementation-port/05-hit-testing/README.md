# 05 Hit-Testing - Tutorial: Port Style Implementation

# Customizing hit-testing

Styles not only provide a visual representation for graph items. They also offer crucial parts for interacting with said items. Hit-testing determines whether a particular item is at a given point in the canvas. It happens all the time during interaction, e.g. when selecting items, moving nodes, or creating edges.

The default implementation in the `PortStyleBase` class only considers the bounds returned by `getBounds` when hit-testing. When ports have shapes that deviate from the rectangular bounds, hit-testing has to be adjusted by providing a different implementation for the `isHit` method.

In this example, we have to adjust the hit-test to the circular port shape. We also take the hit-test radius into account. This radius enables a bit of fuzziness when hit-testing the item, so you can still hit it when youâ€™re slightly outside.

```
protected isHit(
  context: IInputModeContext,
  location: Point,
  port: IPort
): boolean {
  // get the ellipse bounds
  const bounds = this.getBounds(context, port)
  // use a convenience function to check if the location is inside the ellipse
  return GeomUtilities.ellipseContains(
    bounds,
    location,
    context.hitTestRadius
  )
}
```

Note

Try this implementation by hovering the ports. Notice that the ports at the red node, which uses the default hit-test, also detects hits outside the visual circle within the bounds. The ports at the blue node use the adjusted hit-test code and detect the hover only in the circle.
